	abstract = {The usefulness of current psychiatric classification, which is based on {ICD}/{DSM} categorical diagnoses, remains questionable. A promising alternative has been put forward as the “transdiagnostic” approach. This is expected to cut across existing categorical diagnoses and go beyond them, to improve the way we classify and treat mental disorders. This systematic review explores whether self-defining transdiagnostic research meets such high expectations. A multi-step Web of Science literature search was performed according to an a priori protocol, to identify all studies that used the word “transdiagnostic” in their title, up to May 5, 2018. Empirical variables which indexed core characteristics were extracted, complemented by a bibliometric and conceptual analysis. A total of 111 studies were included. Most studies were investigating interventions, followed by cognition and psychological processes, and neuroscientific topics. Their samples ranged from 15 to 91,199 (median 148) participants, with a mean age from 10 to more than 60 (median 33) years. There were several methodological inconsistencies relating to the definition of the gold standard ({DSM}/{ICD} diagnoses), of the outcome measures and of the transdiagnostic approach. The quality of the studies was generally low and only a few findings were externally replicated. The majority of studies tested transdiagnostic features cutting across different diagnoses, and only a few tested new classification systems beyond the existing diagnoses. About one fifth of the studies were not transdiagnostic at all, because they investigated symptoms and not disorders, a single disorder, or because there was no diagnostic information. The bibliometric analysis revealed that transdiagnostic research largely restricted its focus to anxiety and depressive disorders. The conceptual analysis showed that transdiagnostic research is grounded more on rediscoveries than on true innovations, and that it is affected by some conceptual biases. To date, transdiagnostic approaches have not delivered a credible paradigm shift that can impact classification and clinical care. Practical “{TRANSD}”iagnostic recommendations are proposed here to guide future research in this field.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article defines and explains the transdiagnostic approach to cognitive-behavioral therapy ({CBT}) and elaborates on its conceptual foundations and implications for research and practice. We argue that the approach has good philosophical, historical, pragmatic, and empirical foundations. We distinguish between transdiagnostic approaches based on multiple processes that are universally applied (e.g., Harvey, Watkins, Mansell, \& Shafran, 2004), multiple processes limited in the range of disorders covered (e.g., Fairburn, Cooper, \& Shafran, 2003), symptom-based accounts (e.g., Persons, 1986), and universal single process accounts (e.g., experiential avoidance, self-absorption). We summarize existing evidence and identify key issues relating to the methodology of future research on the transdiagnostic approach. The article concludes by highlighting the great potential benefits of the approach and highlights significant practical, political, and scientific obstacles to putting it into practice on a large scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Predictive modeling using neuroimaging data has the potential to improve our understanding of the neurobiology underlying psychiatric disorders and putatively information interventions. Accordingly, there is a plethora of literature reviewing published studies, the mathematics underlying machine learning, and the best practices for using these approaches. As our knowledge of mental health and machine learning continue to evolve, we instead aim to look forward and “predict” topics that we believe will be important in current and future studies. Some of the most discussed topics in machine learning, such as bias and fairness, the handling of dirty data, and interpretable models, may be less familiar to the broader community using neuroimaging-based predictive modeling in psychiatry. In a similar vein, transdiagnostic research and targeting brain-based features for psychiatric intervention are modern topics in psychiatry that predictive models are well-suited to tackle. In this work, we target an audience who is a researcher familiar with the fundamental procedures of machine learning and who wishes to increase their knowledge of ongoing topics in the field. We aim to accelerate the utility and applications of neuroimaging-based predictive models for psychiatric research by highlighting and considering these topics. Furthermore, though not a focus, these ideas generalize to neuroimaging-based predictive modeling in other clinical neurosciences and predictive modeling with different data types (e.g., digital health data).},

	abstract = {Mental health conditions cause a great deal of distress or impairment; depression alone will affect 11\% of the world’s population. The application of Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) and big-data technologies to mental health has great potential for personalizing treatment selection, prognosticating, monitoring for relapse, detecting and helping to prevent mental health conditions before they reach clinical-level symptomatology, and even delivering some treatments. However, unlike similar applications in other fields of medicine, there are several unique challenges in mental health applications, which currently pose barriers toward the implementation of these technologies. Specifically, there are very few widely used or validated biomarkers in mental health, leading to a heavy reliance on patient- and clinician-derived questionnaire data as well as interpretation of new signals such as digital phenotyping. In addition, diagnosis also lacks the same objective “gold standard” as in other conditions such as oncology, where clinicians and researchers can often rely on pathological analysis for confirmation of diagnosis. In this chapter, we discuss the major opportunities, limitations, and techniques used for improving mental healthcare through {AI} and big data. We explore both the computational, clinical, and ethical considerations and best practices as well as lay out the major researcher directions for the near future.},
